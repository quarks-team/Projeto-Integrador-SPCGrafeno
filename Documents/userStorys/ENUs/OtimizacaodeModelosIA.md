# User Story: AI Model Optimization

### - [PT/BR - Version](https://github.com/quarks-team/Projeto-Integrador-SPCGrafeno/blob/main/Documents/userStorys/PTBRUs/OtimizacaodeModelosIA.md)

## Description
As a data scientist, I want to optimize the selected AI models, so that I can achieve greater accuracy in predicting credit scores and invoice finalizations.

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
- [ ] The user story is clearly defined and aligned with sprint objectives.
- [ ] The AI models that need optimization are identified and documented.
- [ ] The data required for optimization is available and ready for use.
- [ ] The team has access to tools and techniques for AI model optimization.
- [ ] Success criteria for model optimization are clearly defined.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] The optimization of the AI models has been completed, and the revised models are ready for use.
- [ ] The optimization results have been tested, showing a significant improvement in prediction accuracy.
- [ ] Performance reports comparing models before and after optimization are documented and available for review.
- [ ] The code and methods used for optimization are well-documented and versioned in the repository.
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback on the improved prediction accuracy is positive, and any necessary adjustments have been made.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Improved Accuracy:
- [ ] The accuracy of the optimized AI models must be measured and presented in comparison to previous versions.

### Quantifiable Improvement:
- [ ] The optimization must result in a quantifiable increase in the accuracy of credit score predictions and invoice finalizations.

### Complete Documentation:
- [ ] Complete documentation of the changes made during the optimization process must be available to the team.

### Reproducibility:
- [ ] The team should be able to reproduce the optimization results using the documented data and methods.

### Integration:
- [ ] The optimized models must be integrated into the system and ready for use in the production environment.
