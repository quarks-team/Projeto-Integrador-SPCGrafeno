# User Story: Data Transformation for AI

### - [PT/BR - Version](https://github.com/quarks-team/Projeto-Integrador-SPCGrafeno/blob/main/Documents/userStorys/PTBRUs/transformacaoDosDadosParaIA.md)

## Description
As a data engineer, I want to transform and clean the data according to pre-defined rules, so that unnecessary data is removed, and clean data is accessible for testing AI algorithms.

## Definition of Ready (DOR)
- [ ] **Data Cleaning Rules Defined:**
  - Business rules and data transformation guidelines (such as which fields should be kept, removed, or transformed) are clearly defined and documented.

- [ ] **Data Availability:**
  - The raw data required for transformation is accessible and available in the correct format.

- [ ] **Transformation Tools Available:**
  - Data transformation and cleaning tools and libraries are ready and available to be used in the process.

- [ ] **Test Environment Configured:**
  - An AI test environment is available to verify that transformed data can be used for training and testing AI algorithms.

- [ ] **Unit and Integration Test Plan:**
  - A test plan is defined and prepared to ensure correct transformation and cleaning of data.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] **Clean and Transformed Data:**
  - All raw data has been processed according to the pre-defined rules, and unnecessary data has been removed.

- [ ] **Accessible Transformed Data:**
  - Transformed data is accessible for use and correctly formatted for AI algorithm testing.

- [ ] **Updated Documentation:**
  - Documentation of the transformation rules and steps taken in the cleaning process has been updated and validated by the data engineering team.

- [ ] **Unit and Integration Testing Completed:**
  - Unit tests ensure the transformed data is correct.
  - Integration tests have been successfully completed, confirming that the data can be used in AI algorithms without errors or inconsistencies.

- [ ] **Data Quality Validation:**
  - The quality of transformed data has been validated to ensure no loss of critical information and that the data is ready for AI testing.

- [ ] **Team Approval:**
  - The team has reviewed and approved the transformed data and cleaning process after ensuring compliance with defined rules.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Compliance with Transformation Rules:
- [ ] The transformation and cleaning process strictly followed pre-defined rules, and unnecessary data was correctly removed.

### Data Prepared for Testing:
- [ ] Transformed data is in the proper format and available for AI algorithm testing.

### No Corrupted Data:
- [ ] Clean data contains no invalid, missing, or corrupted values, ensuring the integrity of the dataset.

### Execution Performance:
- [ ] The data transformation and cleaning process did not negatively impact system execution time or performance.

### Quality Tests Passed:
- [ ] Quality and integration tests confirmed that the data is ready for use in the AI test environment, with no errors or need for rework.
