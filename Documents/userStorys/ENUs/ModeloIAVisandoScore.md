# User Story: AI Model for Credit Scoring

### - [PT/BR - Version](https://github.com/quarks-team/Projeto-Integrador-SPCGrafeno/blob/main/Documents/userStorys/PTBRUs/ModeloIAVisandoScore.md)

## Description
As a data scientist, I want to test various AI algorithms that generate a credit score for each endorser so that I can evaluate their reliability in fulfilling their credit obligations.

## Definition of Ready (DOR)
- [ ] Historical data for endorsers is available and ready for use.
- [ ] Requirements for the credit score model are clearly defined.
- [ ] Necessary resources for implementing the algorithms (computing power, tools, etc.) are available.
- [ ] Stakeholders have agreed on the criteria for evaluating the performance of the algorithms.
- [ ] Algorithms to be tested have been shortlisted.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Algorithm Selection:
- [ ] A suitable AI algorithm for credit score generation must be researched and selected.
- [ ] The selection must be justified based on criteria such as accuracy, performance, and scalability.

### Algorithm Implementation:
- [ ] The selected algorithms must be implemented in a testing environment using historical endorser data.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- [ ] The performance of the algorithms must be evaluated based on metrics such as:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- [ ] These metrics will be used to measure the model's reliability in predicting the credit score.

### Cross-Validation:
- [ ] Cross-validation must be performed to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

### Comparative Results:
- [ ] There must be a clear comparison between the tested algorithms, highlighting which one offers the best combination of accuracy and efficiency for the endorsers' credit scenario.

### Technical Documentation:
- [ ] The process of choosing the algorithms, the testing methodology, and the results of each model must be thoroughly documented for future reference and to ensure transparency in development.
