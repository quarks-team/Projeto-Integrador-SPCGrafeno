# User Story: CI Pipeline for Frontend

### - [PT/BR - Version](https://github.com/quarks-team/Projeto-Integrador-SPCGrafeno/blob/main/Documents/userStorys/PTBRUs/CIPipelineForFrontend.md)

## Description
As a frontend developer, I want a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for the frontend repository, so that unit and integration tests are automatically executed to maintain development standards.

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
- [ ] The user story is clearly defined and aligned with the sprint goals.
- [ ] Requirements for the CI pipeline are documented and accepted by the team.
- [ ] Necessary tools and services for implementing the CI pipeline are available and integrated with the repository.
- [ ] The development environment is configured to support the CI pipeline.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] The CI pipeline is implemented and functional in the frontend repository.
- [ ] All unit and integration tests are automatically executed as part of the CI process.
- [ ] Test reports are generated and accessible to the team after each pipeline execution.
- [ ] Documentation for the CI pipeline is complete, including instructions for maintenance and operation.
- [ ] Team feedback on the pipeline is positive, and necessary adjustments have been made.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Automated Triggering:
- [ ] The CI pipeline must be triggered automatically on every push or pull request to the repository.

### Passing Tests Required:
- [ ] All unit and integration tests must pass before a pull request can be accepted.

### Test Reports:
- [ ] Test execution reports must be generated and accessible through the CI interface.

### Notifications for Failures:
- [ ] The system should notify the team in case of test failures or pipeline execution errors.

### Pipeline Adjustments:
- [ ] The team should be able to make adjustments to the pipeline as necessary, with clear documentation available.
