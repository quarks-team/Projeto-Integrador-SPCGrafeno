# User Story: AI Invoice Finalization Prediction

### - [PT/BR - Version](https://github.com/quarks-team/Projeto-Integrador-SPCGrafeno/blob/main/Documents/userStorys/PTBRUs/preverFinalizacaoDeFaturas.md)

## Description
As a data scientist, I want to develop an AI model that predicts whether an invoice will be finalized, so that I can help the finance team identify invoices with a high probability of finalization.

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
- [ ] The user story is clearly defined and prioritized within the sprint backlog.
- [ ] The data requirements for training and testing the model are identified and available.
- [ ] Success metrics for evaluating the AI model are defined and agreed upon by the team.
- [ ] Access to the necessary tools and resources for model development is ensured.
- [ ] Stakeholders have been identified, and their expectations have been documented.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] The AI model has been developed and validated with an appropriate dataset.
- [ ] The model’s accuracy has been measured and meets the predefined success criteria.
- [ ] The model is capable of accurately predicting the finalization of invoices on new data.
- [ ] Complete documentation of the model, including methodology, data used, and results, is available.
- [ ] The model has been integrated into the system and is accessible for use by the finance team.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Prediction Accuracy:
- [ ] The model must be able to predict invoice finalization with an agreed minimum accuracy (e.g., 80%).

### Validation with Real Data:
- [ ] The prediction results should be tested and validated using real historical invoice data.

### Documentation:
- [ ] Detailed documentation of the model development process and the data used should be presented.

### Finance Team Access:
- [ ] The finance team should be able to access and easily interpret the predictions generated by the model.

### Feedback and Future Improvements:
- [ ] Feedback from the finance team regarding the model’s utility and accuracy must be collected and considered for future improvements.
